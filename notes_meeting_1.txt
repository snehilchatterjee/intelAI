sequence of images given we'll have to detect whether any of them is pixelated or not

any part of image can contain the pixelation (from what I understand it's the mosiac blur)

at least 30fps detection (60 is better)

at least 20fps correction 


Questions:

1) Part of the image will be pixelated (like mosaic blur) or whole image (like a low-res image basically stretched) ?



How can we reconstruct highly blurred objects, like human faces, without an existing photo of the subject (assuming that in real-life scenarios, we won't know what is behind the blurred area) ?
